# Loan-Shark

"Hey dude can you spot me?"
And so the panic begins...
Will they pay you back?
When will they pay you back?
They said they would pay you back but will they really?
Should you ask them about it even though its only been an hour?

This is the pain of loaning money, and hey times are tough!
So just keep track with your own personal loan manager.
